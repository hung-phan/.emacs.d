;;
;; ** Installation
;;
;; 1. Config melpa source, please read: http://melpa.org/#/getting-started
;; 2. M-x package-install RET switch-window RET
;;
;; Note: User can install switch-window with [[http://github.com/dimitri/el-get][El-Get]] too.
;;
;; ** Configure and Usage
;;
;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (require 'switch-window)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") 'switch-window)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 1") 'switch-window-then-maximize)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 2") 'switch-window-then-split-below)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 3") 'switch-window-then-split-right)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 0") 'switch-window-then-delete)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE
;;
;; ** Tips
;;
;; *** I want to select a window with "a-z" instead of "1-9".
;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (setq switch-window-shortcut-style 'qwerty)
;; (setq switch-window-qwerty-shortcuts
;;       '("a" "s" "d" "f" "j" "k" "l" ";" "w" "e" "i" "o"))
;; #+END_EXAMPLE
;;
;; *** I want to let window to show bigger label.
;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (setq switch-window-increase 6) ;Increase or decrease this number.
;; #+END_EXAMPLE
;;
;; *** I want to *hide* window label when window's number < 3
;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (setq switch-window-threshold 2)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE
;;
;; *** I want to select minibuffer with label "z".
;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (setq switch-window-minibuffer-shortcut "z")
;; #+END_EXAMPLE
;;
;; *** Switch-window seem to conflict with Exwm, how to do?
;; By default, switch-window get user's input with the help
;; of function `read-event', this approach does not work well
;; with [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][Exwm]] (Emacs X window manager),
;; user should set the below variable and use minibuffer
;; to get input instead:
;;
;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (setq switch-window-input-style 'minibuffer)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE
;;
;; *** I want to make switch-window beautiful?
;; All you should to do is setting the variable
;; `switch-window-label-buffer-function', for example:
;;
;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (setq switch-window-label-buffer-function
;;       'my-switch-window-label-buffer-function)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE
;;
;; The below are some switch-window user's showcases:
;;
;; [[./snapshots/switch-window-2.png]]
;; [[./snapshots/switch-window-3.png]]
;;
;; *** Have any other similar package exist?
;; - [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window][ace-window]]
